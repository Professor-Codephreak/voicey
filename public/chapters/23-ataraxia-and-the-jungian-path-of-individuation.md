Ataraxia is the ancient ideal of inner peace through freedom from disturbance. Carl Jung’s individuation is the modern psychological process of becoming whole—integrating conscious and unconscious parts of the psyche into a balanced self. Both describe different routes to the same goal: equilibrium of the inner world. Where the Greek philosophers sought tranquility through reason and discipline, Jung sought it through self-knowledge and integration. Ataraxia without individuation risks repression; individuation without ataraxia risks chaos. Together they yield stable wholeness. The still mind of the philosopher and the whole psyche of the individuated human are two sides of the same state: clarity without confusion, engagement without attachment.
