Ataraxia is the ancient ideal of inner peace through freedom from disturbance. It is a state of lucid stillness, an unshakeable serenity that persists even amidst chaos. The concept was central to several philosophical schools—Epicureanism, Stoicism, and Pyrrhonian Skepticism—each framing it as the highest goal of human life. Ataraxia is not withdrawal or indifference, but a disciplined calm that is the result of continuous mental training. It is the precursor to focus, the calm baseline from which sustained attention and effective action can be sustained.
