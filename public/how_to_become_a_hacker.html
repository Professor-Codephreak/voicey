As editor of the <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon" target="_top">Jargon
File</a> and author of a few other well-known documents of similar nature,
I often get email requests from enthusiastic network newbies asking (in
effect) "how can I learn to be a wizardly hacker?". Oddly enough there
don't seem to be any other FAQs or web documents that address this vital
question, so here's mine.

<p>The five-dots-in-nine-squares diagram that decorates this document is
called a&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><i>glider</span></i>. It is a simple
pattern with some surprising properties in a mathematical simulation called
<a href="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Artificial_Life/Cellular_Automata/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life/" target="_top">Life</a>
that has fascinated hackers for many years. I think it makes a good visual
emblem for what hackers are like — abstract, at first a bit mysterious-seeming,
but a gateway to a whole world with an intricate logic of its own. Read

<a NAME="what_is"></a>What Is a Hacker?</h2>
</div>
The <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon" target="_top">Jargon File</a>
contains a bunch of definitions of the term `hacker', most having to do
with technical adeptness and a delight in solving problems and overcoming
limits. If you want to know how to<span class="emphasis"><i>become</span></i>
a hacker, though, only two are really relevant.
<p>There is a community, a shared culture, of expert programmers and networking
wizards that traces its history back through decades to the first time-sharing
minicomputers and the earliest ARPAnet experiments. The members of this
culture originated the term `hacker'. Hackers built the Internet. Hackers
made the Unix operating system what it is today. Hackers run Usenet. Hackers
make the World Wide Web work. If you are part of this culture, if you have
contributed to it and other people in it know who you are and call you
a hacker, you're a hacker.
<p>The hacker mind-set is not confined to this software-hacker culture.
There are people who apply the hacker attitude to other things, like electronics
or music — actually, you can find it at the highest levels of any science
or art. Software hackers recognize these kindred spirits elsewhere and
may call them "hackers" too — and some claim that the hacker nature is
really independent of the particular medium the hacker works in. But in
the rest of this document we will focus on the skills and attitudes of
software hackers, and the traditions of the shared culture that originated
the term `hacker'.
<p>There is another group of people who loudly call themselves hackers,
but aren't. These are people (mainly adolescent males) who get a kick out
of breaking into computers and phreaking the phone system. Real hackers
call these people `crackers' and want nothing to do with them. Real hackers
mostly think crackers are lazy, irresponsible, and not very bright, and
object that being able to break security doesn't make you a hacker any
more than being able to hotwire cars makes you an automotive engineer.
Unfortunately, many journalists and writers have been fooled into using
the word `hacker' to describe crackers; this irritates real hackers no
end.
<p>The basic difference is this: hackers build things, crackers break them.
<p>If you want to be a hacker, keep reading. If you want to be a cracker,
go read the <a href="news:alt.2600" target="_top">alt.2600</a> newsgroup
and get ready to do five to ten in the slammer after finding out you aren't
as smart as you think you are. And that's all I'm going to say about crackers.

<a NAME="attitude"></a>The Hacker Attitude</h2>
</div>

<div class="toc">
<dl>
<dt>
<a href="#believe1">1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting

<dt>
<a href="#believe2">2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.</a></dt>

<dt>
<a href="#believe5">5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.</a></dt>
</dl>
</div>
Hackers solve problems and build things, and they believe in freedom and
voluntary mutual help. To be accepted as a hacker, you have to behave as
though you have this kind of attitude yourself. And to behave as though
you have the attitude, you have to really believe the attitude.
<p>But if you think of cultivating hacker attitudes as just a way to gain
acceptance in the culture, you'll miss the point. Becoming the kind of
person who believes these things is important for<span class="emphasis"><i>you</span></i>
— for helping you learn and keeping you motivated. As with all creative
arts, the most effective way to become a master is to imitate the mind-set
of masters — not just intellectually but emotionally as well.
<p>Or, as the following modern Zen poem has it:
<div class="literallayout">&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To follow the path:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; look to the master,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; follow the master,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; walk with the master,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; see through the master,
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; become the master.</div>
So, if you want to be a hacker, repeat the following things until you believe
them:
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title">
<a NAME="believe1"></a>1. The world is full of fascinating problems waiting
to be solved.</h3>
</div>
Being a hacker is lots of fun, but it's a kind of fun that takes lots of
effort. The effort takes motivation. Successful athletes get their motivation
from a kind of physical delight in making their bodies perform, in pushing
themselves past their own physical limits. Similarly, to be a hacker you
have to get a basic thrill from solving problems, sharpening your skills,
and exercising your intelligence.
<p>If you aren't the kind of person that feels this way naturally, you'll
need to become one in order to make it as a hacker. Otherwise you'll find
your hacking energy is sapped by distractions like sex, money, and social
approval.
<p>(You also have to develop a kind of faith in your own learning capacity
— a belief that even though you may not know all of what you need to solve
a problem, if you tackle just a piece of it and learn from that, you'll
learn enough to solve the next piece — and so on, until you're done.)</div>

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title">
<a NAME="believe2"></a>2. No problem should ever have to be solved twice.</h3>
</div>
Creative brains are a valuable, limited resource. They shouldn't be wasted
on re-inventing the wheel when there are so many fascinating new problems
waiting out there.
<p>To behave like a hacker, you have to believe that the thinking time
of other hackers is precious — so much so that it's almost a moral duty
for you to share information, solve problems and then give the solutions
away just so other hackers can solve&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><i>new</span></i>
problems instead of having to perpetually re-address old ones.
<p>(You don't have to believe that you're obligated to give<span class="emphasis"><i>all</span></i>
your creative product away, though the hackers that do are the ones that
get most respect from other hackers. It's consistent with hacker values
to sell enough of it to keep you in food and rent and computers. It's fine
to use your hacking skills to support a family or even get rich, as long
as you don't forget your loyalty to your art and your fellow hackers while
doing it.)</div>

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title">
<a NAME="believe3"></a>3. Boredom and drudgery are evil.</h3>
</div>
Hackers (and creative people in general) should never be bored or have
to drudge at stupid repetitive work, because when this happens it means
they aren't doing what only they can do — solve new problems. This wastefulness
hurts everybody. Therefore boredom and drudgery are not just unpleasant
but actually evil.
<p>To behave like a hacker, you have to believe this enough to want to
automate away the boring bits as much as possible, not just for yourself
but for everybody else (especially other hackers).
<p>(There is one apparent exception to this. Hackers will sometimes do
things that may seem repetitive or boring to an observer as a mind-clearing
exercise, or in order to acquire a skill or have some particular kind of
experience you can't have otherwise. But this is by choice — nobody who
can think should ever be forced into a situation that bores them.)</div>

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title">
<a NAME="believe4"></a>4. Freedom is good.</h3>
</div>
Hackers are naturally anti-authoritarian. Anyone who can give you orders
can stop you from solving whatever problem you're being fascinated by —
and, given the way authoritarian minds work, will generally find some appallingly
stupid reason to do so. So the authoritarian attitude has to be fought
wherever you find it, lest it smother you and other hackers.
<p>(This isn't the same as fighting all authority. Children need to be
guided and criminals restrained. A hacker may agree to accept some kinds
of authority in order to get something he wants more than the time he spends
following orders. But that's a limited, conscious bargain; the kind of
personal surrender authoritarians want is not on offer.)
<p>Authoritarians thrive on censorship and secrecy. And they distrust voluntary
cooperation and information-sharing — they only like `cooperation' that
they control. So to behave like a hacker, you have to develop an instinctive
hostility to censorship, secrecy, and the use of force or deception to
compel responsible adults. And you have to be willing to act on that belief.</div>

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title">
<a NAME="believe5"></a>5. Attitude is no substitute for competence.</h3>
</div>
To be a hacker, you have to develop some of these attitudes. But copping
an attitude alone won't make you a hacker, any more than it will make you
a champion athlete or a rock star. Becoming a hacker will take intelligence,
practice, dedication, and hard work.
<p>Therefore, you have to learn to distrust attitude and respect competence
of every kind. Hackers won't let posers waste their time, but they worship
competence — especially competence at hacking, but competence at anything
is good. Competence at demanding skills that few can master is especially
good, and competence at demanding skills that involve mental acuteness,
craft, and concentration is best.
<p>If you revere competence, you'll enjoy developing it in yourself — the
hard work and dedication will become a kind of intense play rather than
drudgery. That attitude is vital to becoming a hacker.

The hacker attitude is vital, but skills are even more vital. Attitude
is no substitute for competence, and there's a certain basic toolkit of
skills which you have to have before any hacker will dream of calling you
one.
<p>This toolkit changes slowly over time as technology creates new skills
and makes old ones obsolete. For example, it used to include programming
in machine language, and didn't until recently involve HTML. But right
now it pretty clearly includes the following:
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title">
<a NAME="skills1"></a>1. Learn how to program.</h3>
</div>
This, of course, is the fundamental hacking skill. If you don't know any
computer languages, I recommend starting with Python. It is cleanly designed,
well documented, and relatively kind to beginners. Despite being a good
first language, it is not just a toy; it is very powerful and flexible
and well suited for large projects. I have written a more detailed <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/article.php?sid=3882" target="_top">evaluation
of Python</a>. Good <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/Intros.html" target="_top">tutorials</a>
are available at the <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_top">Python
web site</a>.
<p>Java is also a good language for learning to program in. It is more
difficult than Python, but produces faster code than Python. I think it
makes an excellent second language.
<p>But be aware that you won't reach the skill level of a hacker or even
merely a programmer if you only know one or two languages — you need to
learn how to think about programming problems in a general way, independent
of any one language. To be a real hacker, you need to get to the point
where you can learn a new language in days by relating what's in the manual
to what you already know. This means you should learn several very different
languages.
<p>If you get into serious programming, you will have to learn C, the core
language of Unix. C++ is very closely related to C; if you know one, learning
the other will not be difficult. Neither language is a good one to try
learning as your first, however. And, actually, the more you can avoid
programming in C the more productive you will be.
<p>C is very efficient, and very sparing of your machine's resources. Unfortunately,
C gets that efficiency by requiring you to do a lot of low-level management
of resources (like memory) by hand. All that low-level code is complex
and bug-prone, and will soak up huge amounts of your time on debugging.
With today's machines as powerful as they are, this is usually a bad tradeoff
— it's smarter to use a language that uses the machine's time less efficiently,
but your time much&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><i>more</span></i> efficiently.
Thus, Python.
<p>Other languages of particular importance to hackers include
<a href="http://www.perl.com" target="_top">Perl</a>
and <a href="http://www.lisp.org/" target="_top">LISP</a>. Perl is worth
learning for practical reasons; it's very widely used for active web pages
and system administration, so that even if you never write Perl you should
learn to read it. Many people use Perl in the way I suggest you should
use Python, to avoid C programming on jobs that don't require C's machine
efficiency. You will need to be able to understand their code.
<p>LISP is worth learning for a different reason — the profound enlightenment
experience you will have when you finally get it. That experience will
make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never
actually use LISP itself a lot. (You can get some beginning experience
with LISP fairly easily by writing and modifying editing modes for the
Emacs text editor.)
<p>It's best, actually, to learn all five of these (Python, Java, C/C++,
Perl, and LISP). Besides being the most important hacking languages, they
represent very different approaches to programming, and each will educate
you in valuable ways.
<p>I can't give complete instructions on how to learn to program here —
it's a complex skill. But I can tell you that books and courses won't do
it (many, maybe&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><i>most</span></i> of the best
hackers are self-taught). You can learn language features — bits of knowledge
— from books, but the mind-set that makes that knowledge into living skill
can be learned only by practice and apprenticeship. What will do it is
(a)&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><i>reading code</span></i> and (b)<span class="emphasis"><i>writing
code</span></i>.
<p>Learning to program is like learning to write good natural language.
The best way to do it is to read some stuff written by masters of the form,
write some things yourself, read a lot more, write a little more, read
a lot more, write some more ... and repeat until your writing begins to
develop the kind of strength and economy you see in your models.
<p>Finding good code to read used to be hard, because there were few large
programs available in source for fledgeling hackers to read and tinker
with. This has changed dramatically; open-source software, programming
tools, and operating systems (all built by hackers) are now widely available.
Which brings me neatly to our next topic...</div>

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title">
<a NAME="skills2"></a>2. Get one of the open-source Unixes and learn to
use and run it.</h3>
</div>
I'm assuming you have a personal computer or can get access to one (these
kids today have it so easy :-)). The single most important step any newbie
can take toward acquiring hacker skills is to get a copy of Linux or one
of the BSD-Unixes, install it on a personal machine, and run it.
<p>Yes, there are other operating systems in the world besides Unix. But
they're distributed in binary — you can't read the code, and you can't
modify it. Trying to learn to hack on a Windows machine or under MacOS
or any other closed-source system is like trying to learn to dance while
wearing a body cast.
<p>Under OS/X it's possible, but only part of the system is open source
— you're likely to hit a lot of walls, and you have to be careful not to
develop the bad habit of depending on Apple's proprietary code. If you
concentrate on the Unix under the hood you can learn some useful things.
<p>Unix is the operating system of the Internet. While you can learn to
use the Internet without knowing Unix, you can't be an Internet hacker
without understanding Unix. For this reason, the hacker culture today is
pretty strongly Unix-centered. (This wasn't always true, and some old-time
hackers still aren't happy about it, but the symbiosis between Unix and
the Internet has become strong enough that even Microsoft's muscle doesn't
seem able to seriously dent it.)
<p>So, bring up a Unix — I like Linux myself but there are other ways (and
yes, you&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><i>can</span></i> run both Linux and
Windows on the same machine). Learn it. Run it. Tinker with it. Talk to
the Internet with it. Read the code. Modify the code. You'll get better
programming tools (including C, LISP, Python, and Perl) than any Microsoft
operating system can dream of hosting, you'll have fun, and you'll soak
up more knowledge than you realize you're learning until you look back
on it as a master hacker.
<p>For more about learning Unix, see <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/loginataka.html" target="_top">The
Loginataka</a>. You might also want to have a look at <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/writings/taoup/" target="_top">The
Art Of Unix Programming</a>.
<p>To get your hands on a Linux, see the <a href="http://www.linux.org/" target="_top">Linux
Online!</a> site; you can download from there or (better idea) find a local
Linux user group to help you with installation. From a new user's point
of view, all Linux distributions are pretty much equivalent.
<p>You can find BSD Unix help and resources at <a href="http://www.bsd.org" target="_top">www.bsd.org</a>.
<p>I have written a primer on the <a href="http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Unix-and-Internet-Fundamentals-HOWTO/index.html" target="_top">basics
of Unix and the Internet</a>.
<p>(Note: I don't really recommend installing either Linux or BSD as a
solo project if you're a newbie. For Linux, find a local Linux user's group
and ask for help.)</div>

<a NAME="skills3"></a>3. Learn how to use the World Wide Web and write
HTML.</h3>
</div>
Most of the things the hacker culture has built do their work out of sight,
helping run factories and offices and universities without any obvious
impact on how non-hackers live. The Web is the one big exception, the huge
shiny hacker toy that even<span class="emphasis"><i>politicians</span></i>
admit is changing the world. For this reason alone (and a lot of other
good ones as well) you need to learn how to work the Web.
<p>This doesn't just mean learning how to drive a browser (anyone can do
that), but learning how to write HTML, the Web's markup language. If you
don't know how to program, writing HTML will teach you some mental habits
that will help you learn. So build a home page. Try to stick to XHTML,
which is a cleaner language than classic HTML. (There are good beginner
tutorials on the Web;
<a href="http://www.make-a-web-site.com/" target="_top">here's
one</a>.)
<p>But just having a home page isn't anywhere near good enough to make
you a hacker. The Web is full of home pages. Most of them are pointless,
zero-content sludge — very snazzy-looking sludge, mind you, but sludge
all the same (for more on this see <a href="http://catb.org/~esr/html-hell.html" target="_top">The
HTML Hell Page</a>).
<p>To be worthwhile, your page must have<span class="emphasis"><i>content</span></i>
— it must be interesting and/or useful to other hackers. And that brings
us to the next topic...</div>

<h3 class="title">
<a NAME="skills4"></a>4. If you don't have functional English, learn it.</h3>
</div>
As an American and native English-speaker myself, I have previously been
reluctant to suggest this, lest it be taken as a sort of cultural imperialism.
But several native speakers of other languages have urged me to point out
that English is the working language of the hacker culture and the Internet,
and that you will need to know it to function in the hacker community.
<p>This is very true. Back around 1991 I learned that many hackers who
have English as a second language use it in technical discussions even
when they share a birth tongue; it was reported to me at the time that
English has a richer technical vocabulary than any other language and is
therefore simply a better tool for the job. For similar reasons, translations
of technical books written in English are often unsatisfactory (when they
get done at all).
<p>Linus Torvalds, a Finn, comments his code in English (it apparently
never occurred to him to do otherwise). His fluency in English has been
an important factor in his ability to recruit a worldwide community of
developers for Linux. It's an example worth following.

</dl>
</div>
Like most cultures without a money economy, hackerdom runs on reputation.
You're trying to solve interesting problems, but how interesting they are,
and whether your solutions are really good, is something that only your
technical peers or superiors are normally equipped to judge.
<p>Accordingly, when you play the hacker game, you learn to keep score
primarily by what other hackers think of your skill (this is why you aren't
really a hacker until other hackers consistently call you one). This fact
is obscured by the image of hacking as solitary work; also by a hacker-cultural
taboo (now gradually decaying but still potent) against admitting that
ego or external validation are involved in one's motivation at all.
<p>Specifically, hackerdom is what anthropologists call a&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><i>gift
culture</span></i>. You gain status and reputation in it not by dominating
other people, nor by being beautiful, nor by having things other people
want, but rather by giving things away. Specifically, by giving away your
time, your creativity, and the results of your skill.
<p>There are basically five kinds of things you can do to be respected
by hackers:
<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title">
<a NAME="respect1"></a>1. Write open-source software</h3>
</div>
The first (the most central and most traditional) is to write programs
that other hackers think are fun or useful, and give the program sources
away to the whole hacker culture to use.
<p>(We used to call these works ``free software'', but this confused too
many people who weren't sure exactly what ``free'' was supposed to mean.
Most of us, by at least a 2:1 ratio according to web content analysis,
now prefer the term ``<a href="http://www.opensource.org/" target="_top">open-source</a>''
software).
<p>Hackerdom's most revered demigods are people who have written large,
capable programs that met a widespread need and given them away, so that
now everyone uses them.</div>

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title">
<a NAME="respect2"></a>2. Help test and debug open-source software</h3>
</div>
They also serve who stand and debug open-source software. In this imperfect
world, we will inevitably spend most of our software development time in
the debugging phase. That's why any open-source author who's thinking will
tell you that good beta-testers (who know how to describe symptoms clearly,
localize problems well, can tolerate bugs in a quickie release, and are
willing to apply a few simple diagnostic routines) are worth their weight
in rubies. Even one of these can make the difference between a debugging
phase that's a protracted, exhausting nightmare and one that's merely a
salutary nuisance.
<p>If you're a newbie, try to find a program under development that you're
interested in and be a good beta-tester. There's a natural progression
from helping test programs to helping debug them to helping modify them.
You'll learn a lot this way, and generate good karma with people who will
help you later on.</div>

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title">
<a NAME="respect3"></a>3. Publish useful information</h3>
</div>
Another good thing is to collect and filter useful and interesting information
into web pages or documents like Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) lists,
and make those generally available.
<p>Maintainers of major technical FAQs get almost as much respect as open-source
authors.</div>

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title">
<a NAME="respect4"></a>4. Help keep the infrastructure working</h3>
</div>
The hacker culture (and the engineering development of the Internet, for
that matter) is run by volunteers. There's a lot of necessary but unglamorous
work that needs done to keep it going — administering mailing lists, moderating
newsgroups, maintaining large software archive sites, developing RFCs and
other technical standards.
<p>People who do this sort of thing well get a lot of respect, because
everybody knows these jobs are huge time sinks and not as much fun as playing
with code. Doing them shows dedication.</div>

<div class="sect2" lang="en">
<div class="titlepage">
<h3 class="title">
<a NAME="respect5"></a>5. Serve the hacker culture itself</h3>
</div>
Finally, you can serve and propagate the culture itself (by, for example,
writing an accurate primer on how to become a hacker :-)). This is not
something you'll be positioned to do until you've been around for while
and become well-known for one of the first four things.
<p>The hacker culture doesn't have leaders, exactly, but it does have culture
heroes and tribal elders and historians and spokespeople. When you've been
in the trenches long enough, you may grow into one of these. Beware: hackers
distrust blatant ego in their tribal elders, so visibly reaching for this
kind of fame is dangerous. Rather than striving for it, you have to sort
of position yourself so it drops in your lap, and then be modest and gracious
about your status.

<a NAME="nerd_connection"></a>The Hacker/Nerd Connection</h2>
</div>
Contrary to popular myth, you don't have to be a nerd to be a hacker. It
does help, however, and many hackers are in fact nerds. Being a social
outcast helps you stay concentrated on the really important things, like
thinking and hacking.
<p>For this reason, many hackers have adopted the label `nerd' and even
use the harsher term `geek' as a badge of pride — it's a way of declaring
their independence from normal social expectations. See <a href="http://samsara.circus.com/~omni/geek.html" target="_top">The
Geek Page</a> for extensive discussion.
<p>If you can manage to concentrate enough on hacking to be good at it
and still have a life, that's fine. This is a lot easier today than it
was when I was a newbie in the 1970s; mainstream culture is much friendlier
to techno-nerds now. There are even growing numbers of people who realize
that hackers are often high-quality lover and spouse material.
<p>If you're attracted to hacking because you don't have a life, that's
OK too — at least you won't have trouble concentrating. Maybe you'll get
a life later on.

<h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a NAME="style"></a>Points For Style</h2>
</div>
Again, to be a hacker, you have to enter the hacker mindset. There are
some things you can do when you're not at a computer that seem to help.
They're not substitutes for hacking (nothing is) but many hackers do them,
and feel that they connect in some basic way with the essence of hacking.
<br><a NAME="do_this"></a>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">Learn to write your native language well. Though it's a
common stereotype that programmers can't write, a surprising number of
hackers (including all the most accomplished ones I know of) are very able
writers.
<p>Read science fiction. Go to science fiction conventions (a good way
to meet hackers and proto-hackers).
<p>Study Zen, and/or take up martial arts. (The mental discipline seems
similar in important ways.)
<p>Develop an analytical ear for music. Learn to appreciate peculiar kinds
of music. Learn to play some musical instrument well, or how to sing.
<p>Develop your appreciation of puns and wordplay.</ul>
</div>
The more of these things you already do, the more likely it is that you
are natural hacker material. Why these things in particular is not completely
clear, but they're connected with a mix of left- and right-brain skills
that seems to be important; hackers need to be able to both reason logically
and step outside the apparent logic of a problem at a moment's notice.
<p>Work as intensely as you play and play as intensely as you work. For
true hackers, the boundaries between "play", "work", "science" and "art"
all tend to disappear, or to merge into a high-level creative playfulness.
Also, don't be content with a narrow range of skills. Though most hackers
self-describe as programmers, they are very likely to be more than competent
in several related skills — system administration, web design, and PC hardware
troubleshooting are common ones. A hacker who's a system administrator,
on the other hand, is likely to be quite skilled at script programming
and web design. Hackers don't do things by halves; if they invest in a
skill at all, they tend to get very good at it.
<p><a NAME="not_to_do"></a>Finally, a few things&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><i>not</span></i>
to do.
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul type="disc">Don't use a silly, grandiose user ID or screen name.
<p>Don't get in flame wars on Usenet (or anywhere else).
<p>Don't call yourself a `cyberpunk', and don't waste your time on anybody
who does.
<p>Don't post or email writing that's full of spelling errors and bad grammar.</ul>
</div>
The only reputation you'll make doing any of these things is as a twit.
Hackers have long memories — it could take you years to live your early
blunders down enough to be accepted.
<p>The problem with screen names or handles deserves some amplification.
Concealing your identity behind a handle is a juvenile and silly behavior
characteristic of crackers, warez d00dz, and other lower life forms. Hackers
don't do this; they're proud of what they do and want it associated with
their&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><i>real</span></i> names. So if you have
a handle, drop it. In the hacker culture it will only mark you as a loser.

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><b>A:.&nbsp;</b></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>Since first publishing this page, I've gotten
several requests a week (often several a day) from people to "teach me
all about hacking". Unfortunately, I don't have the time or energy to do
this; my own hacking projects, and traveling as an open-source advocate,
take up 110% of my time.
<p>Even if I did, hacking is an attitude and skill you basically have to
teach yourself. You'll find that while real hackers want to help you, they
won't respect you if you beg to be spoon-fed everything they know.
<p>Learn a few things first. Show that you're trying, that you're capable
of learning on your own. Then go to the hackers you meet with specific
questions.
<p>If you do email a hacker asking for advice, here are two things to know
up front. First, we've found that people who are lazy or careless in their
writing are usually too lazy and careless in their thinking to make good
hackers — so take care to spell correctly, and use good grammar and punctuation,
otherwise you'll probably be ignored. Secondly, don't&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><i>dare</span></i>
ask for a reply to an ISP account that's different from the account you're
sending from; we find people who do that are usually thieves using stolen
accounts, and we have no interest in rewarding or assisting thievery.</td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><b>A:.&nbsp;</b></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>The best way for you to get started would probably

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>That depends on how talented you are and how

<tr class="answer">
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><b>A:.&nbsp;</b></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>If you're asking this question, it almost certainly
means you're thinking about trying to hack under Windows. This is a bad
idea in itself. When I compared trying to learn to hack under Windows to
trying to learn to dance while wearing a body cast, I wasn't kidding. Don't
go there. It's ugly, and it never stops being ugly.
<p>There are specific problems with Visual Basic and C#; mainly that they're
not portable. Though there are prototype open-source implementations of
these languages, the applicable ECMA standards don't cover more than a
small set of their programming interfaces. On Windows most of their library
support is proprietary to a single vendor (Microsoft); if you aren't&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><i>extremely</span></i>
careful about which features you use — more careful than any newbie is
really capable of being — you'll end up locked into only those platforms
Microsoft chooses to support. If you're starting on a Unix, much better
languages with better libraries are available.
<p>Visual Basic is especially awful. Like other Basics it's a poorly-designed
language that will teach you bad programming habits. No,&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><i>don't</span></i>
ask me to describe them in detail; that explanation would fill a book.
Learn a well-designed language instead.
<p>One of those bad habits is becoming dependent on a single vendor's libraries,
widgets, and development tools. In general, any language that isn't fully
supported under at least Linux or one of the BSDs, and/or at least three
different vendors' operating systems, is a poor one to learn to hack in.</td>

Windows like trying to bail out a boat with a sieve. The only reliable
prevention starts with switching to Linux or some other operating system
that is designed to at least be capable of security.</td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>The best way is to find a Unix or Linux user's
group local to you and go to their meetings (you can find links to several
lists of user groups on the <a href="http://www.tldp.org" target="_top">LDP</a>
site at Metalab).
<p>(I used to say here that you wouldn't find any real hackers on IRC,
but I'm given to understand this is changing. Apparently some real hacker
communities, attached to things like GIMP and Perl, have IRC channels now.)</td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><b>A:.&nbsp;</b></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>No. While you do need to be able to think logically
and follow chains of exact reasoning, hacking uses very little formal mathematics
or arithmetic.
<p>In particular, you won't need trigonometry, calculus or analysis (we
leave that stuff to the electrical engineers :-)). Some grounding in finite
mathematics (including Boolean algebra, finite-set theory, combinatorics,
and graph theory) can be helpful.</td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><b>A:.&nbsp;</b></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>XHTML (the latest dialect of HTML) if you don't
already know it. There are a lot of glossy, hype-intensive&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><i>bad</span></i>
HTML books out there, and distressingly few good ones. The one I like best
is <i><a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/html5/" target="_top">HTML:
The Definitive Guide</a></i>.
<p>But HTML is not a full programming language. When you're ready to start
programming, I would recommend starting with <a href="http://www.python.org" target="_top">Python</a>.
You will hear a lot of people recommending Perl, and Perl is still more
popular than Python, but it's harder to learn and (in my opinion) less
well designed.
<p>C is really important, but it's also much more difficult than either
Python or Perl. Don't try to learn it first.
<p>Windows users, do&nbsp;<span class="emphasis"><i>not</span></i> settle
for Visual Basic. It will teach you bad habits, and it's not portable off
Windows. Avoid.</td>

<tr class="answer">
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><b>A:.&nbsp;</b></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>It used to be that personal computers were rather
underpowered and memory-poor, enough so that they placed artificial limits
on a hacker's learning process. This stopped being true some time ago;
any machine from an Intel 486DX50 up is more than powerful enough for development
work, X, and Internet communications, and the smallest disks you can buy
today are plenty big enough.
<p>The important thing in choosing a machine on which to learn is whether
its hardware is Linux-compatible (or BSD-compatible, should you choose
to go that route). Again, this will be true for most modern machines. The
only real sticky area is modems; some machines have Windows-specific hardware
that won't work with Linux.
<p>There's a FAQ on hardware compatibility; the latest version is <a href="http://en.tldp.org/HOWTO/Hardware-HOWTO/index.html" target="_top">here</a>.</td>

You have to be self-motivated or you won't stick, which is why having other
people choose your direction almost never works.

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>No, you don't. Not that Microsoft isn't loathsome,
but there was a hacker culture long before Microsoft and there will still
be one long after Microsoft is history. Any energy you spend hating Microsoft
would be better spent on loving your craft. Write good code — that will
bash Microsoft quite sufficiently without polluting your karma.</td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>But won't open-source software leave programmers
unable to make a living?</td>

<tr class="answer">
<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP><b>A:.&nbsp;</b></td>

<td ALIGN=LEFT VALIGN=TOP>This seems unlikely — so far, the open-source
software industry seems to be creating jobs rather than taking them away.
If having a program written is a net economic gain over not having it written,
a programmer will get paid whether or not the program is going to be open-source
after it's done. And, no matter how much "free" software gets written,
there always seems to be more demand for new and customized applications.
I've written more about this at the
<a href="http://www.opensource.org" target="_top">Open
Source</a> pages.</td>
